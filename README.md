# Svelte Playground

This is a `svelte` playground scaffolded with `vite` to start a new project. It comes with `normalize.css`, `water.css`, `font-awesome 5` & `stylelint`.

**Assumes `prettier` is already configured.**

`water.css` is a no-class `css` framework which just makes things look good out of the box. It comes with a automatic dark/light theme switching based on `prefer-color-scheme` media query, just use -

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/water.css@2/out/water.css">`.

**Note: Remove the existing stylesheet used for `water.css` which I used to make the theme switcher if you wish to use the automatic theme.**

## Usage
